# Form Builder Application

This is the main form builder application built with Next.js.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `form-ui` - Form components
  - `core-ui` - Design system components

## Development Guidelines
- Use App Router patterns (`app/` directory)
- Follow Next.js best practices for server/client components
- Import components from `@repo/form-ui` and `@repo/core-ui`
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the established file structure:
  - `app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
  - `components/` - Application-specific components
  - `lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
  - `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components when possible
- Use proper TypeScript types for all props and state
- Follow the monorepo's ESLint configuration
