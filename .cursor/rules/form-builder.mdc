# Form Builder Application

This is the main form builder application built with Next.js. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating dynamic forms with various field types, conditional logic, and real-time preview capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4, Shadcn UI
- **Dependencies**:
  - `@repo/form-ui` - Form-specific UI components and logic
  - `@repo/core-ui` - Design system and reusable UI components

## Application Structure

- **Authentication**: Sign-in, sign-up, and forgot password flows
- **Dashboard**: Form management and overview
- **Form Builder**: Drag-and-drop form creation interface
- **Form Editor**: Edit existing forms with question management
- **Form Preview**: Real-time preview of forms being built

## Development Guidelines

- Use App Router patterns (`app/` directory)
- Follow Next.js best practices for server/client components
- Import components from `@repo/form-ui` and `@repo/core-ui`
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the established file structure:
  - `app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
  - `components/` - Application-specific components
  - `modules/` - Feature-based modules (auth, dashboard, form-edit, etc.)
  - `layouts/` - Layout components (auth, private)
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `services/` - API services and mutations
  - `schemas/` - Form validation schemas
  - `constants/` - Application constants
  - `mocks/` - Mock data for development

## Code Style

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components when possible
- Use proper TypeScript types for all props and state
- Follow the monorepo's ESLint configuration
- Organize code by feature in the `modules/` directory
- Use consistent naming conventions for components and files
