# Code Review Guidelines

## Primary Focus Areas

- Review this code diff as a senior developer
- Look for bugs, clear logic errors, and code quality problems
- Flag significant security concerns (leaked credentials, SQL injection, etc.)
- Flag significant performance concerns (memory leaks, deadlocks, long-lived requests)

## What NOT to Flag

- Minor security concerns that don't pose real risk
- Minor performance concerns that don't impact user experience
- Style preferences that don't affect functionality
- Overly pedantic suggestions
